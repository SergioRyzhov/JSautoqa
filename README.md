# Project for the boohoo.com store - Playwright Test Automation

## Project Overview

This project is a test automation framework built with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and TypeScript. It is designed to automate and test core functionalities of a web application such as login, search, product pages, cart management, profile editing, and wishlist management.

The project uses:
- **Page Object Model (POM)** for managing page interactions
- **Singleton Pattern** for browser and page management
- **Allure reporting** for detailed test reports

## Project Structure

- **tests/**: Contains test suites (login, search, product, cart, profile, wishlist, etc.)
- **patterns/**: Holds design pattern implementations (e.g., `BrowserSingleton`, `PageFactory`)
- **pages/**: Contains page classes corresponding to different sections of the web application
- **data/**: Includes test data and locators used throughout the tests
- **helpers/**: Contains utility functions for test operations

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v20 or above)
- **npm** (v10 or above)

### Installation

1. Clone the folder with project from repository:
   ```bash
    git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/SergioRyzhov/JSautoqa.git
    cd JSautoqa
    git sparse-checkout init --cone
    git sparse-checkout set final_project

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install

3. Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and set the necessary environment variables (e.g., BASE_URL, LOGIN_CREDENTIALS, etc.).

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests

To run all the tests in the project:

```bash
npm test
```

### Run Specific Test Suites

You can run specific test suites using the following commands:

- Login Tests:
    ```bash
    npm run test-login
    ```
- Search Tests:
    ```bash
    npm run test-search
    ```
- Product Tests:
    ```bash
    npm run test-product
    ```
- Cart Tests:
    ```bash
    npm run test-cart
    ```

- Cart Tests:
    ```bash
    npm run test-cart
    ```
- Profile Tests:
    ```bash
    npm run test-profile
    ```
- Wishlist Tests:
    ```bash
    npm run test-wishlist
    ```
- Logout Tests:
    ```bash
    npm run test-logout
    ```
## Test Reporting

This project integrates Allure reporting. To generate and view test reports:

1. Run the tests with Allure:
    ```bash
    npm test
2. Generate the Allure report:
    ```bash
    npx allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report
3. Open the report in a browser:
    ```bash
    npx allure open allure-report

## Additional Configurations
- Timeouts: Global timeouts and specific expectations for tests are set in the Playwright configuration file (playwright.config.ts).
- Workers: The tests are configured to run with a single worker (workers: 1) in the config file, ensuring sequential execution. The cause to use 1 worker is captchas.

## APItests

This project automates testing for various API endpoints of the Boohoo platform using Jest and Axios. The tests cover different functionalities setting techical config, retrieving content settings, and verifying schema validation against JSON responses.

### Features

- **Jest**: Used for running test cases and assertions.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests.
- **JSON Schema Validation**: Validates API responses against predefined JSON schemas using `jsonschema`.
- **Structured Configuration**: Headers, constants, and test data are modularized for better maintainability.

### Tests Included

- **SDK API Tests**: Validates bulk SDK requests.
- **Content Settings API Tests**: Sends and validates content setting requests.
- **WebLayers API Tests**: Tests web layer information retrieval.
- **Ajax Settings API Tests**: Retrieves wishlist items with Ajax parameters.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Go to "APItests" directory
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run tests: `npm run test`
